                <h2> Ben Simmons Injury </h2>

                      <p> Ben Simmons suffered a fracture to his right foot on the last day of Sixers training
                      camp. More specifically, Simmons fractured the fifth metatarsel bone in his right foot.
                      he suffered the injury after awkardly landing on a teammates foot during a scrimmage.
                      Sixers GM, Bryan Colangelo, spoke about the injury briefly, but was vague on what Simmons
                      recovery process would be like and how much time he would miss. From what is known about
                      the injury, it can be speculated that the recovery time would be about 2-3 months. So, even
                      if the Sixers were particularly patient and careful with Simmons, odds are we'll see him
                      on the court before the season is over.</p>

                <h3> Source Claims Simmons Agent Won't Allow Him to Play Entire 2016 Season</h3>

                      <p> Bob Cooney of the Daily News claimed on Monday that he has a trusted source who claims
                    "there's no way his agent will let him play this season." Whether or not this is accurate information
                    is unclear. There is clearly alot invested in the long term health of Rich Paul's client
                    Ben Simmons for financial reasons, in particular, a five yeae, $20 million dollar contract
                    that could jump to over $40 million due to performance incentives. What we can see say is that
                    sitting him a whole year would seem to be excessively cautious. While it's true that Simmons
                    should not rush back from a foot fracture like Kevin Durant did, which led to a second injury,
                    you can still be cautious and allow him to play this season. If the average recovery time were
                    2-3 months, and Simmons sat out for 5 months, that would set Simmons for a return in February or March,
                    leaving him with around 3 months of the season left. No matter what the Sixers ultimatley do with Simmons,
                    we can be sure they'll be cautious as evidenced by Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahlil Okafor.</p>
