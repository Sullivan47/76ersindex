             Dario Saric finished his 76ers debut with 10 points, 6 rebounds, and 2 assist. Joel Embiid
                 finished with 6 points and 4 rebounds. Tuesday's game was the fruition of almost three years
                 of waiting for the two to play nba basketball for the Sixers since they were drafted in 2014.
                 Embiid had undergone two foot surgeries, sidelining him for the two season, while Saric honed
                 his skills overseas. It seemed to be a good decision as Saric looked poised and confident in
                 his first NBA game, although an exhibition. He hit his first shot which was a three pointer,
                 one of the key aspects of his game he's improved during his time overseas. Embiid missed his
                 first three shots, all mid-range jumpers. He finally found the bottom of the net on a
                 beautiful post fade away. Not to long after he hit a long two on a catch and shoot with
                 his foot on the three point line. Embiid's other two points came from the free throw line.
                 It was a great showing for a guy who has two and half years of rust to shake off, but you
                 see the flashes of great potential in his game. At 7'2 he towered over his opponents Tyler Zeller and
                 Al Horford, reportedly 7'0 and 6'10 respectively. The jumper we've seen so much of in highlight
                 tapes was on display, as well as his post game he showed in college. Perhaps most importantly,
                 Embiid looked great on defense, blocking two shots, one of which pinned number three overall pick Jaylen
                 Brown on the backboard. Defense is what will more than likely come back quickest for the big man,
                 and once his offense comes along like we know it can, the league should watch out.
