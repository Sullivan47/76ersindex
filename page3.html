                    <p> Joel Embiid finished the 76ers third preseason game against
                      the Cavs with a statline of 12 points on 4-10 shooting, along
                      with 4 rebounds. Embiid also shot 1-2 from three. The eye test
                      shows much more than the statline does however. Embiid got his
                      first bucket on a monster dunk that sent Sixers fans into a frenzy.
                      Embiid later connected on a three after trailing point gaurd TJ
                      McConnel. Embiid showed his confidence in his range and it sure
                      looks like head coach Brett Brown has given him the green light.
                      Embiid botched an easy easy alley oop attempt from McConnel too,
                      something he'll more than likely work out with more playing time
                      and experience. All together, this was a good effort from Embiid,
                      showing off his immpressive athleticism and range. If he can stay
                      healthy, Sixers fans will be in for a fun season.
